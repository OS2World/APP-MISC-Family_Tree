:h1 id=FamilyTree.Family Tree
:i1 id=FamilyTree.Family Tree
:p.A family tree consists of persons, who are related to each
other. The initial family tree contains only one person who
is the origin of the tree and the actual one:
:artwork name='sample1.bmp'.
.*.
Choose :link reftype=hd refid=menuManPartner.Add Partner:elink.
from the context menu of this :link reftype=hd refid=menuMan.person:elink.
and it gets a partner:
:artwork name='sample2.bmp'.
.*.
Now you can add children by choosing
:link reftype=hd refid=menuManChild.Add Child with:elink. from the
context menu of one of them.
By selecting a person with a mouse click, it gets the
red-shaded border - it becomes the actual.
:artwork name='sample3.bmp'.
.*.
Parents for "Adam" are no problem. Select "Adam" by clicking on it and
choose :link reftype=hd refid=menuManParents.Add Parents:elink.
from the :link reftype=hd refid=menuMan.person:elink.'s context menu.
:artwork name='sample4.bmp'.
.*.
Not all persons in the family tree are always shown. It depends
on the origin, which relatives are shown.
All ancestors (direct line) and descendants (with partner) of the
origin are shown.
(Exception: You can change the view of the family tree via the
:link reftype=hd refid=menuMankind.Viewmenu:elink.).
.*.
:p.Try to make "Partner" the new origin by double-clicking on it or
choosing :link reftype=hd refid=menuManOrigin.Origin:elink. from its context menu.
The color of "Partner" changes to :color fc=red.red:color fc=default.
- now it ist the origin of the family tree.
:artwork name='sample5.bmp'.
.*.
Did you notice, that the parents of "Adam" have vanished and only a dotted line
shows they're still there ? But now you could see all ancestors of person "Partner".
.*.
:p.Now let "Child" become the origin (its color changes to :color fc=red.red:color fc=default.)
and add a few siblings via the context-menu from "Adam":
:artwork name='sample6.bmp'.
.*.
The siblings of "Child" are not shown, because they are neither ancestors nor
descendants of it.

:p.Try to build a family tree and change the origin. Change the view by choosing
items from the :link reftype=hd refid=menuMankind.View Menu:elink..
:p.Open the :link reftype=hd refid=winList.List Window:elink., where all
persons are shown in a list.
:p.Open the :link reftype=hd refid=winEdit.Edit Window:elink. and change properties
like name or birth date.

:p.Copyright 1996, 1997 by :link reftype=hd refid=People.Nils Meier:elink.
:note text='Important :'.Please read :hp1.readme.txt:ehp1. for release information !
:p.This is the initial help for Family Tree. If you start the program, you'll
see the main window and get to this help by pressing F1.
:p.The main window consists of a "white piece of paper" with one person
"Adam", a :link reftype=hd refid=toolbar.toolbar:elink. and a window menu.
The principle of a family tree is explained :link reftype=hd refid=FamilyTree.here:elink..
.*.
:p.You can immediately start entering a family tree by selecting a person
(simple mouse-click), activating the context menu of the
:link reftype=hd refid=menuMan.person:elink. (click with right mouse button)
and choosing actions.
Click with the right mouse-button on a free space in the family
and the :link reftype=hd refid=menuMankind.view Menu:elink. appears.
:p.By clicking on the tree with the left mouse-button and keeping
it pressed down you can move the tree around.
.*.
:p.You can save, load and print a family tree via the
:link reftype=hd refid=menuFile.file menu:elink..
The :link reftype=hd refid=menuMankind.view menu:elink.
offers selections to change the family tree view.
Start Rexx scripts that do various reports and im/export
via the :link reftype=hd refid=menuRexxStart.Rexx Menu:elink.
and :link reftype=hd refid=rexxing.program your own Rexx Routines:elink..
:p.You can change the zoom-rate by using the horizontal slider in the
toolbar or by pressing +/-.
:p.If you want to change program or tree settings just open a page
from the :link reftype=hd refid=winOptions.Options Dialog:elink. by
choosing an item from the
:link reftype=hd refid=winOptions.Options Menu:elink..
:p.If you want a default tree to be loaded on startup, just specify its name
on the commandline or the parameter field of the program object.
:p.You can also drag&amp.drop a .fam-file to the main window.

.* ------------------- toolbar    ------------------------------.
:h1 id=toolbar.Toolbar
:i1.Toolbar
In the main window, atop of the tree, is the toolbar:
:artwork name='Toolbar.bmp'.
It shows several buttons. Their meaning is:
:ol.
:li.:link reftype=hd refid=treeLoad.Load data:elink.
:li.:link reftype=hd refid=treeSave.Save data:elink.
:li.:link reftype=hd refid=treePrint.Print data:elink.

.* ------------------- winOptions ------------------------------.
:h1 res=&ID_NOptionsDialog. id=winOptions.Options Dialog
:i1.Options Dialog
:p.You can change properties of FamilyTree here. There are four
notebook pages, to change
:ol compact.
:li.layout options
:li.data assistant options
:li.miscellaneous options
:li.user field options
:eol.

:dl compact.
:dt.:hp2.Layout:ehp2.
:dd.Here you can specify, how the lines between persons in the
tree look like. You can change the detail of information that
is shown in the tree and change the used font and color of visible
items.
:dt.:hp2.Data Assistant:ehp2.
:dd.You can enable assistance here. Depending on an action you take,
like "Add Partner", you can enable the action "gets same address",
so the new partner get the address from the "Actual".
:dt.:hp2.Miscellaneous:ehp2.
:dd.If you're not satified with the date format, FamilyTree has detected
from your system, you can change it here. You can also enable the automatic
focus change to the edit window after a click on a person. That way,
you can click through the tree and change data on the fly, without
moving the mouse to the edit dialog again.
:p.One other thing is the "Try to store relative paths" option.
If it is enabled, FamilyTree tries to store relative paths to all
attached data, like bitmaps. That means, if you have dropped a picture,
that resides in a subdirectory of your tree, FamilyTree cuts off all absolute
path information. FamilyTree will warn you, that it can't store
a relative path, when an attachment is not in a subdirectory.
In that case FamilyTree will store the whole path information.
:p.By enabling "Always preserve non imported Persons", you can specify,
that all imported data, that doesn't make it in a tree, will be preserved
for a later import. When enabled, you can import one tree after the other
and won't be asked every time, what to do with dropped persons.
Keep in mind, that the data is kept in memory until a new import is done!
:dt.:hp2.User Fields:ehp2.
:dd.Here you can define your own data fields for persons
(a maximum of 3 fields is possible in the unregistred version).
There are four types of fields:
:ol compact.
:li.Yes/No
:li.Text
:li.Number
:li.Date
:eol.
:p.The field definitions belong to the opened tree and are saved together
with the tree data.

.* ------------------- winEdit ------------------------------.
:h1 res=&ID_NEditWindow. id=winEdit.Edit Window
:i1.Edit Window
:p.Open the Edit Window via the context-menu of a
:link reftype=hd refid=menuMan.person:elink..
It contains a notebook with five pages:

:artwork name='Edit.bmp'.

:ol.
:li.Page
:p.The first page contains several input fields for various
information about the actual person. Just fill them with your
personal data.

:artwork name='edit1.bmp'.

:p.If you place a tilde (~) in the first-name field, the name
directly following it becomes the given name and is the
only one that is shown in the family tree.
:p.You can delete any date information by pressing
:hp1.ESC:ehp1., when the cursor is in a date field.
A date can also include a date modifier choosable by right-clicking
on it.
:p.Change the sex of a person, by clicking on the "Sex"-button with
the symbol of a person (gray: not specified, blue: male,
red: female).
:p.If the "Actual" has several partners, you can cycle
through them by clicking at the button beside the marriage field.
:p.Drag&amp.Drop any GIF, BMP or PCX to the
picture field or click on the picture to enter a path
manually.
:warning text='Attention:'.FTree only remembers
where the picture resides (Its data is not saved).
If the picture gets moved or deleted later, FTree
can't find it and shows a questionmark.

:li.Page
:p.By defining user fields in the :link reftype=hd refid=winOptions.Options Dialog:elink.,
you add fields to all persons in the tree. You can enter the information
that belongs to the actual person on this page like shown here:

:artwork name='edit2.bmp'.

:li.Page
:p.Documented sources are not implemented yet.

:li.Page
:p.This page shows all events, the actual person has been involved
in. Define events in the :link reftype=hd refid=winEvents.Events Window:elink.,
and drag&amp.drop them to this window to make a connection or
drag&amp.drop a person to the event. You are then asked about the
role that person played in the event.
By right-clicking on an event here, you can choose to remove the
involvement or change how that person was involved in the event.
This sample shows that the actual person has been at two birthday
parties.

:artwork name='edit4.bmp'.

:li.Page
:p. The last page accepts dropped files and stores a reference to
them. When you have a picture or document, that belongs to a certain
person, just drag&amp.drop it here.
You can later modify the file-reference, by right-clicking on it.

:p.You can change the actual event via the notebook on the right
side of the window. An event consists of three pages of data:

:ol.
:li.Page
:p.The first page contains several input fields for various
information about the actual event. Just enter the event's data:

:artwork name='events1.bmp'.

:li.Page
:p.Drag&amp.drop any person from the tree or list window here.
You are then asked, how this person was involved in that event.
By right-clicking on any person in the list, you can modify
it's involvement.

:artwork name='events2.bmp'.
